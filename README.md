# Applying for OD (JNTU-K)

> Note: I have studied in Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering (A), Visakhapatnam which is affiliated to JNTUK. The process I'm writing here is same for students at JNTU and it's affiliated colleges (like ours's). 

### Prerequisites:
1. Provisional Certificate, shortly called as PC, pdf format and max size is 200kb

    - Photograph must be a recent passport style colour picture.
    - Please Donot upload Selfie Photographs
    - Make sure that the picture is in colour, taken against a light-coloured, preferably white, background.
    - Look straight at the camera with a relaxed face if the picture is taken on a sunny day, have the sun behind you, or place yourself in the shade, so that you are not squinting and there are no harsh shadows if you wear glasses make sure that there are no reflections and your eyes can be clearly seen.
    - Caps,hats and dark glasses are not acceptable. Religious headwear is allowed but it must not cover your face.
    - Dimensions 456 x 568 pixels (preferred) Size of file should be between 80-100 kb
    - The image must be saved with your hallticket number for example:10791A0404.jpg
    - The image must be saved with jpg format. 

## Important Note

Generally the application portal may throw you an error like this (sorry for bad clarity) when you try to apply for OD. Remember to wait for 2 days from the date you have taken PC for their system to get updated. 

If the error persists for more than 2 days, contact JNTUK via their enquiry numbers. They will recitfy this within 2 days. I have faced this issue and luckily got it recitified within 3 hours (Lucky me.. :) )
